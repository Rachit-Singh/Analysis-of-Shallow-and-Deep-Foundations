# Analysis-of-Shallow-and-Deep-Foundations

The Shallow Foundations spreadsheet is designed for estimation of load bearing capacity of shallow foundations. Works with SPT N-values as well. Uses the guidelines from IS 6403-1981. Plate load test data can be used to estimate the foundation settlement as well.

Piles python code is developed to estimate load bearing capacity of deep foundations (piles). It is a full fledged program that provides report creation feature as well. IS 2911-2010 guidelines were followed for calculations. 
Information  regarding the reports saved can be accessed within the program itself. 

# NOTE: 
Reading the instructions provided inside the program is a MUST. All the information can't be written here. It tells which all assumptions were made, what is the correct way for giving input parameters etc.
If running the script on Linux or Mac, make the script executable first. Then run the program. All the packages not already installed are taken care of the program itself. Make sure you are connected to the internet when running the program for the first time.


# Side note:- 
If possible, download the latest Windows Terminal, freely available on Microsoft Store and use that for running the script. It is truly magical. It supports windows, ubuntu, opensuse and many more terminals in a single package. Bash scripting can be done from Windows easily. Pretty amazing.
Plus it supports emojis as well. On running in the normal command prompt, weird symbols will be visible in place of sweet emojis ☹️.(that are present in the program). Linux and Mac support emojis from way back.
